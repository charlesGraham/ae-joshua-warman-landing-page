                        <h3>Q: Can I cash-out refinance my current home in the Bay Area to buy another in Sacramento?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, that is a strategy some of our clients use to buy. It's a great way to build your wealth as your mortgage can be paid down by renting out your Bay Area home. Every month you will gain more and more equity as tenants pay your mortgage down.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h3>Q: What are some of the best neighborhoods?</h3>
                        <p>This is highly subjective. We usually like to ask you a few questions to see what your highest priorities are. Good schools, being close to downtown, large lots of land, etc all play into what fits best for you.</p>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h3>Q: How long will it take to find a home?</h3>
                        <p>It depends. The market has been more competitive recently. Typically cash offers or clients who have pre-underwritten loans approvals (which we offer) have the best chance at getting offers accepted. We also offer services to find you off market homes which can help you get into a home much quicker.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h3>Q: Are first time buyer programs available?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, we offer multiple programs. Some have no income limits and others are limited to between $130-170k max for income you can make and still qualify.</p>
